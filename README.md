### Problem Statement

The rampant rise in air pollution in Indian metropolitan cities like
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, etc. has been a major contributing factor
towards degrading the ambient air quality day by day. The degradation of
air quality is a major environmental problem that affects people living
in several urban areas and the wildlife of the surrounding regions. The
data regarding the air quality index is arbitrarily available and comes
from discrete sources; it is not present layer-wise or timeline-wise on
a single platform. We aim to provide a platform that will overcome this
situation by mapping the air quality data of major cities in India.

### Objectives

-   To obtain historical as well as live data to be mapped using Google
    Maps API.

-   To create a Flask server to facilitate data availability for the
    frontend which will host the Google Maps API.

-   To build a frontend using React.js to display data that has been
    mapped on Google Maps.

-   To deploy the Flask server on Heroku to ensure constant data
    collection and availability by scheduling API calls.

The Flask API thus made is deployed
[here](http://swas-aqiapi.herokuapp.com) using Heroku\
The React.js frontend has been deployed on Google Cloud Platform's App Engine [here](https://air-quality-mapping-312616.el.r.appspot.com/)
